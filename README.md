# Item List Application

This is a simple JavaScript web application that allows users to add and delete items from a list. It uses the `json-server` package to simulate a backend server for handling items.

## Features
- **Add Item**: Users can input a name for a new item and add it to the list.
- **Delete Item**: Users can delete an item from the list.
- The app communicates with a `json-server` backend, which stores items in a mock database (`db.json`).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for the page structure.
- **CSS** for basic styling (optional).
- **JavaScript** for DOM manipulation, event handling, and server communication.
- **json-server** to simulate a backend for storing items.
